# Number Guessing Game
 This is my first C language project. It is a number guessing game(number 1-100).  It generates a random number and asks the player to  guess the number, if the guessed number is low it displays higher the number and if the number is high it displays lower the number. In the end, when the correct number is guessed it also tells how many chances a player took to guess.
